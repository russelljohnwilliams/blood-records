Simple and easy. Add unlimited custom fields in groups to registration, checkout, profile, my account & product pages with location rules*.

== Description ==

This free plugin enables WooCommerce builtin billing and shipping fields at registration page, and adds an additional field (mobile phone) to registration, checkout and user profile pages. These features are enabled by default after activation and configuration is 
optional. High level of customisation is available when you need it. You may use a graphical user interface to add or delete custom fields even with the free version. See [CIO Custom Fields for Woo  documentation](http://vipp.com.au/cio-custom-fields-importer/custom-fields-woocommerce-customers/) for tutorials. 

This plugin may help you in the following scenario:

* You run an e-commerce website using WooCommerce, you or your clients hope to collect and display extra information to provide better personalised service to customers.

* You wish to include extra images and texts to help customers with the registration and checkout page. 

* You run a consulting or membership based match making business as your solutions are often tailor made to suit customers. You may even wish to grant access to certain user information by user role, or have the flexibility of displaying information on certain pages or posts.

When activated, CIO Custom Fields for Woo  creates the WooCommerce builtin custom fields (billing and shipping addresses) and stores data in a format to share with a free plugin [PODS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/). You may use PODS graphical user interface to modify, add unlimited number of custom fields, or delete the custom fields. You can easily change the sequence, add or delete fields by dragging and dropping, or inserting unlimited forms anywhere you like using PODS form.

The label you type will override WooCommerce's default labels. For example for the custom field called "billing_city", you can type "Suburb" or labels in your own local language to display in the custom fields.

Once configuration is finished, if you don't need pods forms, PODS can be safely deactivated. The free version of CIO Custom Fields for Woo  does not need PODS to run. 

CIO Custom Fields for Woo  fully integrates with CIO Custom Fields Importer for data import and ongoing updating. This is useful when you are migrating to WordPress and WooCommerce. 

* You may add unlimited custom fields with the free version. Some features, such as custom fields groups, location rules and access control are available in [CIO Custom Fields for Woo Professional Edition](http://vipp.com.au/cio-custom-fields-importer/custom-fields-woocommerce-customers) only.

== Installation ==


To install the CIO Custom Fields for Woo  Customers, unzip the downloaded zip file and upload the folder to /wp-content/plugins/, and then activate the plugin from the Plugins page in WordPress.

If you are using Pods and have extended user with custom fields (meta storage), your extended user and custom fields will be used instead. 


If registration is enabled at My Account page, WooCommerce's registration form is located in the second column of its default login page template. The page may look strange if you add many custom fields to the registration form. You may need to design your own login template by modifying WooCommerce's login template. Please keep all the action hooks in the template.

A sample login form template is included in the premium version of the plugin.

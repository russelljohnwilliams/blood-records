== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Will this plugin work for themes other than Storefront?**
No. This plugin was designed to work for the Storefront theme, utilizing Storefront's action hooks and filters. Activating the plugin while using a different theme will trigger a warning.

**I've activated the plugin. Where can I access the settings?**
The settings for this plugin can be found in the Customizer page under Appearance. In that page, find the section named "Header".

**I want to use Storefront Designer. Will it have a conflict on the header layout?**
When you have Storefront Designer enabled, the layout picker of Storefront Header Picker will be disabled. The Storefront Designer's layout picker will have priority to avoid CSS conflicts with two layout pickers enabled. The checkboxes to disable/enable the product search bar and the cart menu dropdown will be the only function that will work.
